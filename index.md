This session is designed to be fun! The idea is that we can follow it together online, but that we can be free to move at our own pace. We're going to be doing some basic python programming in this activity. If you're not too familiar with Python, don't worry, you'll be able to follow along :) !

The idea with this acitivity isn't to become an ACE python programmer in 1 hour, but it's just to get an **appreciation** of programming robots. So that you can use this knowledge for good in the future :)!

* We'll be using the [robotbenchmark](https://robotbenchmark.net/) website.
* Click on the **Start** button next to the **Wall Following** activity
* Click on **Start programming this benchmark**
* You should see the scene below


![image1](images/image1.png)


First we're going to get familiar with how we control our view of the 3D simulation. We need to find how many ultrasonic sensors there are! Let's control the viewpoint to count how many ultrasonic sensors there are on the robot.

**Use the mouse to move the viewpoint and count the number of sensors**
* **Rotate:** click on a 3D object in the scene with the left mouse button and drag the mouse pointer. The viewpoint will rotate around the object.
* **Translate:** click in the scene with the right mouse button and drag the mouse pointer.
* **Zoom:** click in the 3D scene and roll the mouse wheel. It is also possible to zoom by pressing the mouse wheel and dragging the mouse forward or backwards.
* **Tilt:** press the mouse wheel over the 3D scene and drag the mouse to the left or to the right. Pressing simultaneously the left and right mouse buttons is equivalent to pressing the mouse wheel.

* We're still going to be using the **Wall Following** activity at the [robotbenchmark](https://robotbenchmark.net/) website. So you can keep this open all the time!
* We're going to get our robot moving!!
* When you're ready to program the robot, right click on it, and select **Edit controller**

![image2](images/image2.png)

* A window will pop up with python code in it! This is how we program our virtual robot.
* Delete all the code in the robot controller window, by hightlighting it all (or pressing **ctrl-A**) and then pressing **delete**
* Copy and paste the code from below into the robot controller window, by hightlighting it all (or pressing **ctrl-A**) then right clicking and pressing **copy**
  
![image3](images/image3.png)

* Start the simulation by following the instrucitons in the image above
* You should see the robot approach the wall, but then reverse quickly when it senses it!
* Have a look at the python functions that are making the robot move in the 'Start of main program' section of the code. We'll discuss these together!

<h2>Activity #3</h2>
</div>

<!--Comment: End of html bootstrap -->

<!--Comment: Back to markdown -->

* Let's have a look at how the robot is sensing the wall
* Open up the console by following the instructions in the image below, then run the simulation
![image4](images/image4.png)
* The console is where the robot prints messages to us!
* Let's discuss what it is saying

**Questions**
*Let's answer these questions as a group*
* Can you see the moment at which the robot detects the distance to the wall? 
* How does the robot detect the wall?
* What should the robot do when it detects a wall?


# Let's change the robot's movement behaviour

<!--Comment: Back to markdown -->

* What would we do if we wanted to change the behaviour of the robot when it reaches the wall? 
* Let's alter the code together to make this happen! Our goal is to make the robot move backwards, but not as far.
* Open the 'controller' (code editor) for the robot
* ![image2](images/image2.png)
* Scroll to the section of the code which looks like this (it should be lines 168-189):

```python
# ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
# ~~~~ MAKE YOUR EDITS BELOW HERE ~~~
# ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
    
    
print("hello :)")
    
# Move backward 
startMoveBackward(5)
# Keep going until we are 1m away from the wall
while True:
    robot.step(500)
    direction, distance = getClosestObjectToRobot()
    print("direction = {}, distance = {}").format(direction, distance) 
    # If the object is too far, then stop moving backward!
    if distance != None and distance > 1:
        break
    
    
# ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
# ~~~~ END OF YOUR CODE EDITS ~~~
# ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
```

* Let's discuss this code together.
* How would we change the code so that when the robot changes direction (from fowards to backwards) then it prints our name e.g. "hello there ..."?
* How would we make the robot move backwards less far?
* Take a look at the hint and example answers if you're stuck!

  For printing to the console, try having a look at the code line: print("hello :)")

  For the movement, try having a look at the "if statement"!
