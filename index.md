This session is designed to be fun! The idea is that we can follow it together online, but that we can be free to move at our own pace. We're going to be doing some basic python programming in this activity. If you're not too familiar with Python, don't worry, you'll be able to follow along :) !

* We'll be using the [robotbenchmark](https://robotbenchmark.net/) website.
* Click on the **Start** button next to the **Wall Following** activity
* Click on **Start programming this benchmark**
* You should see the scene below

First we're going to get familiar with how we control our view of the 3D simulation. We need to find how many ultrasonic sensors there are! Let's control the viewpoint to count how many ultrasonic sensors there are on the robot.

**Use the mouse to move the viewpoint and count the number of sensors**
* **Rotate:** click on a 3D object in the scene with the left mouse button and drag the mouse pointer. The viewpoint will rotate around the object.
* **Translate:** click in the scene with the right mouse button and drag the mouse pointer.
* **Zoom:** click in the 3D scene and roll the mouse wheel. It is also possible to zoom by pressing the mouse wheel and dragging the mouse forward or backwards.
* **Tilt:** press the mouse wheel over the 3D scene and drag the mouse to the left or to the right. Pressing simultaneously the left and right mouse buttons is equivalent to pressing the mouse wheel.
